This is the repository of [The Three Spookiest Python Mistakes video tutorial](https://youtu.be/Wx9-ylQeL2Y). If you wish to support me, please subscribe to the Cool Kitten Coding Café YouTube channel.

## Requirements

You can choose to simply read the [Halloween Jupyter notebook online](https://github.com/CoolKittenCodingCafe/python-mistakes-halloween/blob/master/Halloween%20jupyter%20notebook.ipynb). Or you may choose to download the repository and open the Halloween Jupyter notebook from your computer. I recommend setting up [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), launching the Jupyter notebook, then navigating to the folder you downloaded to open the Halloween notebook. Then you will be able to run the code and play with it.
